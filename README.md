# Setup

## Install the Required Libraries

Before running the project, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. The project dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To set up your environment, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Python project is located.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project


2. **Activate Virtual Environment (Optional):**

    If you are using a virtual environment, activate it. If you don't have a virtual environment, you can skip this step.
    
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux or macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows


3. **Install Dependencies:**

    Use the following command to install the required libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
    This will install all the necessary libraries along with their specific versions.

4. **Run the Project:**

    Now that the dependencies are installed, you can run the project using the main Python file. Use the following command:
    
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    This will start the hand-tracking application.
